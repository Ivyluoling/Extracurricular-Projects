# Game Project: [Tic Tac Toe]

## Overview
This project is the first in a series within my game projects portfolio, derived from following the "100 Days of Code - 2024 Web Development Bootcamp." It's designed to demonstrate and improve my web development skills through practical application in web development.

## Features
- **Original Tutorial Features**: Includes all base functionalities as instructed in the bootcamp, utilizing similar CSS styles and JavaScript logic.
- **Personal Enhancements**:
  - **User Interaction**: Enhanced the player's experience by modifying how the game handles the requirement for players to enter a valid name before starting:
    - Replaced the default alert system with a custom overlay that pops up an error window, providing a more integrated and less disruptive user experience.

## Technical Details
- **Languages Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Concepts Applied**: DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional logic

## Modifications and Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I:
- Practiced following detailed instructions to replicate complex functionalities.
- Improved my understanding of user experience design by implementing a more subtle and effective error handling system.
- Gained experience in modifying and extending existing code to include new features.

## Reflections
While I am satisfied with the functional enhancements, I plan to revisit the stylistic elements, such as color choices and variable names, to refine the game's aesthetics and code readability.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the game file in a web browser to start playing.
3. Ensure to enter a valid name to fully engage with the game's features.

Feel free to explore the code, and any feedback or contributions to improve the game are highly welcome!
