# Tic Tac Toe Repository

## Introduction & Explaination
This is the first game project that I followed instruction from 100 Days of Code - 2024 Web Development Bootcamp.
This repository serves as a personal portfolio of game projects and a playground for experimenting with new coding techniques in web development. 

I followed basically all CSS styles and JavaScript files for my version of color choice and variable naming are not very satisfying.
I modified the part of handling situations that players need to enter a valid name and then can start the game.
Instead of display an alert, I chose to use the same overlay feature that pop up a error window to display error message, which add one more function in scripts files.
