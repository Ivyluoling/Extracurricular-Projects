# Game Projects Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my Game Projects Repository! Here you'll find a variety of game projects developed through following online tutorials. Each project is an exploration into game development techniques, ranging from basic to more complex interactions.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a personal portfolio of game projects and a playground for experimenting with new coding techniques in web development. Each game is built by following video tutorials and then tweaked to include personalized changes in both design and functionality.

## How to Use
To try out the games:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the game files in your browser, or run them on a local server if required.
3. Enjoy and explore the code!

## Disclaimer
All game projects in this repository are developed for educational purposes following online tutorials. They are not direct copies but are built as I followed instructions and added some personal modifications. The purpose is to learn and share knowledge, not to infringe on any copyrights.
